#  Overdrive

Overdrive is an iOS Transmission client. This project started when I was unable to find an iOS Transmission client that allows the user to change the media directory of a torrent's content.

Main goals for this project:
* Ability to change media directory for torrent
* Sort torrents by date added, descending
* Eventually, be able to add torrents and torrent files
* Ability to minimally configure multiple servers (may not support odd configurations)

This small subset of features would satisfy my initial requirements. This app does not yet function.
