#  Overdrive

Overdrive is an iOS Transmission client. This project started when I was unable to find an iOS Transmission client that allows the user to change the media directory of a torrent's content. I have never built an iOS app before.

Main goals for this project:
* Ability to change media directory for torrent
* Sort torrents by date added, descending
* Eventually, be able to add torrents and torrent files
* Ability to minimally configure multiple servers (may not support odd configurations)

This small subset of features would satisfy my initial requirements. This app actually functions!

## Features
1. Add servers
2. List torrents (descending by date added)
3. Change torrent path (and move data) based on existing path options

## Enhancements
1. Change torrent path to new, not yet used, path
2. Add torrents (file / magnet / URL)
3. Sort by different criteria
4. Filter by seeding, downloading, etc.
5. Show torrent download status
6. Show more torrent details in list view
7. Fix that pesky layout issue I'm having with torrent table
8. Dark theme?
9. Add that little arrow that goes to the right on the table cells haha
10. Add check mark when table cell is selected on paths view
